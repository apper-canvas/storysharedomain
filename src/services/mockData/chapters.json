    "content": "The sky burned crimson the night everything changed.\n\nLyra pressed her face against the cold stone of her tower window, watching as the aurora-like flames danced across the heavens above the capital. The other apprentices had gathered in the courtyard below, their voices carrying up through the night air—excited whispers about the celestial display, theories about its meaning, nervous laughter that betrayed their underlying fear.\n\nShe knew better than to join them. Master Aldric had made it clear that her place was here, in the tower, studying the ancient texts that spoke of fire in the sky and the choosing of champions. The prophecy was unfolding, just as the dusty tomes had foretold, and somehow—impossibly—it all centered around her.\n\n\"The Crimson Night comes but once in a thousand years,\" she whispered, reciting the words she'd memorized months ago. \"When the sky bleeds fire, the Chosen shall rise.\"\n\nA knock at her door interrupted her recitation. \"Come,\" she called, not turning from the window.\n\nMaster Aldric entered, his usually pristine robes disheveled, his silver beard unkempt. In all her years as his apprentice, Lyra had never seen him look so unsettled.\n\n\"It's time,\" he said simply.\n\nLyra's heart hammered against her ribs. \"Time for what?\"\n\n\"For you to learn the truth about who you really are.\"\n\nThe old mage approached the window, his ancient eyes reflecting the crimson light. \"The prophecy speaks of a child born under the weeping moon, marked by starlight, destined to either save the realm or watch it burn.\"\n\n\"Master, I don't understand—\"\n\n\"You were born seventeen years ago, on the night of the weeping moon. Your parents brought you to me not for training, but for protection.\" His voice grew heavy with the weight of long-kept secrets. \"The mark on your shoulder—you've always believed it was a birthmark.\"\n\nLyra's hand flew instinctively to her left shoulder, where a silver starburst had marked her skin since birth. \"It's not?\"\n\n\"It's the Seal of the Chosen. You, Lyra Nightwhisper, are the subject of the Crimson Prophecy.\"\n\nThe words hit her like a physical blow. The Chosen. The figure from legend who would either unite the fractured kingdoms against the rising darkness or become the very instrument of their destruction. Every child in the realm knew the stories, the warnings, the hopes and fears that surrounded the prophecy.\n\n\"But I'm nobody,\" she breathed. \"I can barely light a candle flame without burning my fingers.\"\n\nMaster Aldric turned to face her, and she saw something she'd never seen in his eyes before: fear.\n\n\"Power calls to power, child. And tonight, something has answered.\"\n\nAs if summoned by his words, a deep rumble shook the tower. Through the window, Lyra watched in horror as shapes began to descend from the burning sky—creatures of shadow and flame, their wings spanning the width of houses, their roars echoing across the capital like thunder.\n\n\"The Shadowkin,\" Master Aldric whispered. \"They've come for you.\"\n\nThe reality of her situation crashed over Lyra like a tidal wave. The comfortable life she'd known, the simple dreams of becoming a court mage, the hope of a quiet future filled with books and small magics—it all crumbled in an instant.\n\n\"What do I do?\" she asked, surprised by the steadiness of her own voice.\n\n\"You run.\" He pressed a leather satchel into her hands. \"Take the back stairs to the stable. Shadowmere is waiting—she's the fastest horse in the kingdom. Ride to the Thornwood, to the cottage of Mira the Wise. She'll know what to do.\"\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\nMaster Aldric smiled, and for a moment he looked like the grandfather she'd never had. \"Someone needs to slow them down.\"\n\nAnother roar, closer this time. The sound of splintering wood and screaming voices echoed from the courtyard.\n\n\"Go,\" he said firmly. \"And Lyra—remember that prophecies are not destiny. You always have a choice.\"\n\nShe wanted to argue, to insist that she stay and fight, but the wisdom of his words and the terror in his eyes convinced her. Clutching the satchel to her chest, she ran.\n\nThe back stairs were narrow and treacherous, lit only by the crimson glow seeping through cracks in the stone. Behind her, she could hear the sounds of battle—Master Aldric's voice raised in the ancient words of power, inhuman shrieks of pain and rage, the crash of stone and spell-fire.\n\nShe burst into the stable to find Shadowmere already saddled, her black coat gleaming in the supernatural light. The mare snorted nervously, sensing the danger that stalked the night.\n\n\"Easy, girl,\" Lyra whispered, swinging up into the saddle with practiced ease. \"We have to run now. Fast and far.\"\n\nShe urged the horse through the stable doors and into the chaos beyond. The academy courtyard was a war zone. Dark creatures swooped and dove while the remaining mages fought back with streams of silver fire. Students ran screaming for shelter, and she caught a glimpse of bodies lying still in the dancing shadows.\n\nShadowmere reared, nearly throwing her as a massive shape plummeted from above. The Shadowkin landed where they had been standing just moments before, its claws gouging deep furrows in the ancient stones. Its eyes—burning coals in a face of living darkness—fixed on Lyra with unmistakable recognition.\n\n\"The Chosen,\" it hissed in a voice like grinding glass. \"Come to us willingly, and we will make your death swift.\"\n\nLyra's response was to drive her heels into Shadowmere's flanks. The mare leaped forward, racing toward the academy gates as more creatures descended around them. Wind whipped Lyra's hair as they galloped through the burning night, the sound of pursuit echoing behind them.\n\nShe didn't look back.\n\nThe Crimson Prophecy had begun, and there was no going back to the life she'd known. Whatever lay ahead in the Thornwood, whatever truths Mira the Wise held, whatever choices awaited her—they would shape not just her fate, but the fate of every living soul in the realm.\n\nAs Shadowmere carried her away from the only home she'd ever known, Lyra made her first choice as the Chosen: she would not let fear decide her path.\n\nThe sky still burned behind them, but ahead lay only darkness and the unknown.",

    "title": "Into the Thornwood",
    "content": "Dawn found Lyra at the edge of the Thornwood, Shadowmere's flanks heaving from their desperate flight through the night.\n\nThe ancient forest stretched before them like a living wall—towering oaks and ash trees whose branches intertwined so thickly that no light penetrated the depths beyond. Twisted thorns as thick as a man's arm wrapped around the outer trees, creating a natural barrier that had kept travelers at bay for centuries.\n\nBut Lyra knew the stories. The Thornwood was more than just a forest; it was a sanctuary, a place where the old magic still ran strong and the creatures of shadow could not follow. If Master Aldric was right, if Mira the Wise still lived somewhere in its depths, then this tangle of wood and thorn represented her only hope of survival.\n\nShe dismounted and approached the barrier, running her fingers along one of the massive thorns. To her surprise, it felt warm to the touch, almost alive. As she watched, the thorns began to part, creating a narrow pathway just wide enough for horse and rider.\n\n\"Well,\" she murmured to Shadowmere, \"I suppose that answers whether we're expected.\"\n\nThe mare snorted nervously but followed Lyra into the forest. The moment they crossed the threshold, the thorns closed behind them with a soft rustling sound, sealing off their escape route. There was no turning back now.\n\nThe path wound deeper into the Thornwood, lit by an ethereal green glow that seemed to emanate from the moss covering the tree trunks. Strange flowers bloomed in the shadows—blues and purples that had no names, their petals shimmering with an inner light. Somewhere in the distance, Lyra could hear the sound of running water and the melodic calls of birds she couldn't identify.\n\nIt was beautiful, but it was also alien. Every step took her further from the world she knew and deeper into a realm governed by laws she didn't understand.\n\nThey walked for what felt like hours, following the winding path as it led them past ancient stone circles covered in glowing runes, through groves where the trees whispered in languages older than human speech, across crystal-clear streams that reflected stars despite the fact that it was full daylight above the canopy.\n\nFinally, the path opened into a circular clearing dominated by a cottage that looked like something from a fairytale. Its walls were made of living wood that curved and twisted into organic shapes, its roof was thick with flowering vines, and its windows glowed with warm golden light. A garden surrounded the cottage, filled with herbs and plants that Lyra recognized from her magical studies—and many more that she didn't.\n\nAn elderly woman sat on a wooden bench beside the cottage door, as if she'd been waiting for them. Her hair was silver-white, braided with flowers, and her eyes were the deep green of forest shadows. She wore simple robes the color of autumn leaves, and she was smiling.\n\n\"Lyra Nightwhisper,\" she said, rising gracefully to her feet. \"I am Mira. Welcome to my home.\"\n\nLyra dismounted, her legs shaky from the long ride. \"Master Aldric sent me. He said you would know what to do.\"\n\nMira's smile faltered slightly. \"Aldric is...?\"\n\n\"I don't know. The Shadowkin attacked the academy. He stayed behind to give me time to escape.\" The words caught in Lyra's throat. The old mage had raised her since childhood, had been the closest thing to family she'd ever known.\n\n\"He is a good man, and a powerful wizard. If anyone could survive such an attack, it would be him.\" Mira's voice was gentle but honest. \"Come, child. You must be exhausted. We have much to discuss, but first you need food and rest.\"\n\nThe interior of the cottage was as magical as its exterior. Books floated on shelves that seemed to stretch higher than the cottage's outer dimensions should allow. Crystals hung from the ceiling, each one pulsing with a different colored light. A fire crackled cheerfully in a stone hearth, despite the fact that no wood was visible in the flames.\n\nMira bustled around the kitchen, preparing tea and simple food while Lyra sank gratefully into a chair by the fire. For the first time since the previous night, she felt safe.\n\n\"You have questions,\" Mira said, setting a steaming mug before her. \"Ask them.\"\n\n\"What am I?\" The question burst out of Lyra before she could stop it. \"Master Aldric said I was the Chosen, but I don't understand what that means. I don't feel special. I don't feel powerful.\"\n\nMira settled into the chair across from her, her ancient eyes studying Lyra's face. \"What do you know of the War of Shadows?\"\n\n\"Only what everyone knows. A thousand years ago, the Shadowlord tried to conquer the realm. The united kingdoms defeated him, but at great cost. He was imprisoned, not destroyed.\"\n\n\"The stories are true, as far as they go. But they leave out important details.\" Mira sipped her tea thoughtfully. \"The Shadowlord was not defeated by armies or conventional magic. He was bound by a sacrifice—the willing surrender of a champion's life force, channeled through an ancient ritual.\"\n\nLyra felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature. \"The first Chosen.\"\n\n\"Elena Starweaver. She gave her life to create the binding that has held the Shadowlord for a millennium. But no binding lasts forever, child. The prison weakens with time, and the Shadowlord's influence grows stronger.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now the binding is failing. The Shadowkin that attacked the academy are just the beginning—the first of his servants to break free. Soon he will follow, and when he does, he will be more powerful than ever.\"\n\nLyra set down her mug with trembling hands. \"So I'm supposed to what—die to stop him? Like Elena did?\"\n\n\"That is one path,\" Mira said carefully. \"The prophecy speaks of two possibilities. The Chosen can follow Elena's example, sacrificing their life to renew the binding. Or...\"\n\n\"Or?\"\n\n\"Or they can choose differently. The magic that marks you as Chosen—it doesn't just have the power to bind. It has the power to destroy. You could kill the Shadowlord permanently, but...\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\nMira's eyes were grave. \"Such power comes with a price. To destroy something so thoroughly, you would have to become something more than human. Something that might, in time, become as dangerous as the enemy you sought to defeat.\"\n\nThe cottage fell silent except for the crackling of the magical fire. Lyra stared into the flames, trying to process what she'd learned. Save the world by dying, or save the world by becoming a monster. Some choice.\n\n\"How long do I have?\" she asked finally.\n\n\"The autumn equinox. When the barriers between worlds are thinnest, his prison will fail completely. That gives us three months to prepare.\"\n\nThree months. It seemed like no time at all, and yet an eternity.\n\n\"What happens now?\"\n\nMira smiled, and for the first time since the conversation began, it reached her eyes. \"Now, dear child, you learn what it truly means to be the Chosen. Your training begins at dawn.\"\n\nThat night, Lyra lay in a bed of woven branches and flower petals, staring up at the cottage's ceiling where tiny lights danced like trapped stars. Through the window, she could see the forest standing guard around them, its ancient magic holding back the darkness.\n\nShe thought about Master Aldric, hoping he was alive. She thought about the life she'd left behind, now seeming as distant as a half-remembered dream. She thought about the choice that awaited her—sacrifice or transformation, both paths leading to an end she couldn't imagine.\n\nBut mostly, she thought about the words Master Aldric had spoken in those final moments: \"Prophecies are not destiny. You always have a choice.\"\n\nMaybe there was a third path, something the prophecy hadn't foreseen. Maybe she could find a way to save everyone without losing herself in the process.\n\nAs sleep finally claimed her, Lyra made herself a promise. She would train, she would learn, she would grow strong. But when the time came to face the Shadowlord, she would make her own choice about what it meant to be the Chosen.\n\nThe prophecy had shaped her past, but it would not dictate her future.",

    "title": "Algorithm of the Heart",
    "content": "Dr. Elena Vasquez stared at the quantum probability matrices scrolling across her holographic display, each equation a testament to humanity's attempt to quantify love.\n\nIn 2089, romance was no longer left to chance. The Global Compatibility Algorithm processed over ten billion data points per individual—genetic markers, neurochemical responses, behavioral patterns, even subconscious micro-expressions captured by omnipresent surveillance networks. The GCA boasted a 97.3% success rate in predicting long-term relationship stability.\n\nElena had helped design that algorithm. She had also never used it.\n\n\"Working late again, Dr. V?\" Her research assistant, Marcus, peered over the partition separating their workstations. His neural interface glowed softly blue at his temple, indicating he was simultaneously running compatibility checks for three different dating apps.\n\n\"The Princeton paradox won't solve itself,\" Elena replied, not looking away from her calculations. The Princeton paradox was her white whale—a theoretical impossibility that suggested two individuals could achieve 100% compatibility despite existing in separate quantum states. According to every law of physics Elena understood, such a connection should be impossible.\n\nAccording to her equations, it was happening anyway.\n\n\"You know,\" Marcus said, powering down his interface, \"the GCA found your perfect match two years ago. Guy named David Chen, works in atmospheric engineering. 96.7% compatibility. You never even responded to the introduction request.\"\n\nElena finally looked up, her dark eyes reflecting the blue glow of the quantum display. \"I didn't design the GCA to find my soulmate, Marcus. I designed it to understand how love works at a fundamental level. There's a difference.\"\n\n\"Is there?\" He gathered his things, clearly preparing to leave. \"Sometimes I think you're more interested in the theory of love than the practice.\"\n\nAfter Marcus left, Elena returned to her work. The Princeton paradox data had been haunting her for months—readings that suggested her theoretical 100% match existed not just somewhere in the world, but somewhere else entirely. Another version of Earth, perhaps, where the quantum states aligned differently.\n\nShe pulled up the interdimensional research files, classified documents that only a handful of scientists in the world were authorized to access. The Meridian Project had been attempting to breach the barriers between parallel realities for over a decade. Their success rate was classified, but Elena suspected it was higher than the public knew.\n\nHer fingers hovered over the keyboard. What she was contemplating wasn't just career suicide—it was potentially dangerous on a cosmic scale. Opening rifts between realities was forbidden for good reason. The last time someone had tried unsanctioned dimensional travel, an entire research facility in New Geneva had simply vanished.\n\nBut the equations were so beautiful, so elegantly impossible. They suggested that somewhere in the infinite multiverse, another version of herself existed—and that version had found her perfect match.\n\nElena made her decision.\n\nShe began typing, her fingers flying across the holographic interface as she constructed a modified version of the Meridian protocols. Instead of trying to physically breach dimensional barriers, she would create a quantum entanglement bridge—a way to exchange information across realities without the risks of physical travel.\n\nHours passed. Coffee grew cold. The laboratory's automated lights dimmed to night mode, but Elena worked on, lost in the mathematics of impossible love.\n\nAt 3:47 AM, the equation resolved.\n\nThe holographic display flickered, then stabilized into a pattern Elena had never seen before—a double helix of quantum signatures that pulsed with an almost organic rhythm. Data began flowing across her screen, compatibility metrics and behavioral patterns and genetic markers that matched her own with terrifying precision.\n\nAnd then, impossibly, a face appeared in the quantum static.\n\nHe was handsome in a quiet way—dark hair slightly mussed, intelligent brown eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, a gentle smile that seemed to be looking directly at her through the dimensional divide. Text scrolled beside the image: Dr. Marco Vasquez, Quantum Physicist, Earth-Prime-7.\n\nElena's breath caught. Vasquez. Her own name, but masculine. In this other reality, was she...?\n\n\"Elena?\" The voice was soft, wondering, transmitted through quantum entanglement across impossible distances. \"Is that really you?\"\n\nShe leaned closer to the display, her heart pounding. \"You can see me?\"\n\n\"I've been trying to reach you for months. The equations—they showed me that somewhere, in another reality, my perfect match existed. I never imagined...\" Marco's voice trailed off, his eyes bright with amazement. \"In my world, you're a theoretical physicist named Marco. And you?\"\n\n\"Elena. Quantum compatibility researcher.\" She laughed, a sound caught between wonder and hysteria. \"We're the same person.\"\n\n\"Variations on a theme,\" Marco agreed. \"Different choices, different genders, but the same core self. According to my calculations, we share 99.97% identical quantum signatures. We are literally perfect for each other.\"\n\nElena stared at this impossible man, this other version of herself who seemed to understand her in ways no one ever had. \"What now? We can't exactly meet for coffee.\"\n\nMarco's smile was rueful. \"No. But we can talk. We can share our research, our thoughts, our dreams. We can be together in every way except the physical.\"\n\nIt should have been frustrating. It should have been heartbreaking. Instead, Elena felt a sense of completion she'd never experienced before. Here was someone who understood not just her work, but the passion that drove it. Someone who looked at the universe with the same wonder and curiosity that kept her awake at night.\n\nThey talked until dawn, sharing stories of their respective realities, comparing research notes, laughing at the small differences and marveling at the profound similarities. In Marco's world, coffee was blue. In Elena's, cats had never been domesticated. But in both realities, two brilliant minds had reached across impossible distances to find each other.\n\nAs the laboratory lights brightened to morning mode, Elena realized she was facing the same impossible choice that had driven her research for years. Logic dictated that she should shut down the connection, report her findings through proper channels, and return to her ordered, solitary life.\n\nLove, apparently, had different ideas.\n\n\"Elena,\" Marco said softly, his image flickering slightly as quantum coherence fluctuated with the sunrise, \"I know this is impossible. I know it violates everything we understand about the nature of reality. But I think... I think I'm falling in love with you.\"\n\nShe looked at him—this beautiful impossibility, this perfect match who existed beyond the reach of physics—and felt her carefully constructed world shift around her.\n\n\"That,\" she whispered, \"makes this the most important experiment of my career.\"\n\nThe Princeton paradox was no longer just theoretical. It was personal.\n\nAnd Elena Vasquez was about to discover that some laws were made to be broken.",

    "title": "Welcome to Rosewood",
    "content": "The wrought iron gates of Rosewood Academy stood twelve feet tall and looked like they could stop a small army.\n\nAvery Chen pressed her face against the car window, watching as the elaborate R and A intertwined in the metalwork passed by. Beyond the gates, the academy sprawled across manicured grounds like something out of a gothic novel—stone buildings with towering spires, ancient oak trees casting long shadows, and students in crisp uniforms walking paths that had been worn smooth by generations of footsteps.\n\n\"Impressive, isn't it?\" Her father glanced at her in the rearview mirror, his voice carefully neutral. Dr. James Chen had perfected that tone over years of delivering difficult diagnoses to worried patients.\n\n\"It looks like Hogwarts had a baby with a prison,\" Avery replied, earning a laugh from her younger brother Tommy.\n\n\"Don't be dramatic,\" her mother chided, but Avery caught the worry lines around her eyes. Mrs. Chen had been against the transfer from the beginning, arguing that Avery's public school in San Francisco had been perfectly adequate. But when the Rosewood Academy board of trustees had offered a full scholarship to the daughter of two hardworking immigrants, the decision had been made.\n\nThe circular driveway led to a massive building that the welcome packet had identified as Blackwood Hall. Students were saying goodbye to parents, hauling luggage toward dormitories, calling out greetings to friends they hadn't seen all summer. Avery watched them through the window—these effortlessly confident teenagers who belonged here in a way she never would.\n\n\"Remember,\" her father said as he parked the car, \"this is an incredible opportunity. Rosewood Academy has sent graduates to every Ivy League school in the country.\"\n\n\"I know, Dad. You've mentioned that. Several times.\"\n\nAs her family helped unload her belongings, Avery took in her new surroundings more carefully. The other students seemed to move with a particular grace, their conversations peppered with references to summer homes in the Hamptons and skiing trips to Aspen. Their uniforms—navy blazers, white shirts, plaid skirts for the girls—looked effortlessly perfect, as if they'd been born wearing them.\n\nAvery's own uniform felt stiff and foreign.\n\n\"Avery Chen?\" A voice behind her made her turn. A tall girl with perfectly straight blonde hair and the kind of smile that never quite reached her eyes approached them. \"I'm Madison Blackwood. Student council president.\"\n\nBlackwood. As in the family that had founded the academy. Of course.\n\n\"Welcome to Rosewood,\" Madison continued, extending a manicured hand. \"I'm here to help you get oriented.\"\n\nThe tour was thorough and politely condescending. Madison showed them the academic buildings (\"where we maintain the highest educational standards in the state\"), the dining hall (\"farm-to-table cuisine, naturally\"), and the dormitories (\"single rooms for seniors, which is quite unusual for prep schools\").\n\nAs they walked, Avery noticed things Madison didn't mention. The way conversations stopped when they passed certain groups of students. The elaborate pin some students wore on their blazers—a silver compass rose that seemed to catch light in unusual ways. The fact that several buildings had sections that were clearly off-limits, marked with signs about \"renovation\" that looked like they'd been there for years.\n\n\"And this,\" Madison said, stopping in front of a building that was noticeably older than the others, \"is Thornfield House. It's been closed for renovations since... well, for quite some time. Best to avoid the area after dark. Construction materials can be dangerous.\"\n\nAvery studied the building. Unlike the pristine condition of the rest of the campus, Thornfield House looked genuinely abandoned. Ivy crawled up its walls, several windows were boarded up, and the whole structure had an air of deliberate neglect.\n\n\"What happened to it?\" she asked.\n\nMadison's smile faltered for just a moment. \"Oh, just typical old building problems. Structural issues, that sort of thing. Nothing interesting.\"\n\nIt was the first lie Madison had told during the tour, and Avery filed it away for future reference.\n\nAfter her parents left—her mother tearful, her father proud, Tommy promising to send her funny memes—Avery found herself alone in her dorm room. It was nice, she had to admit. Much larger than what she'd had at home, with tall windows overlooking the academy grounds and furniture that probably cost more than her family's car.\n\nA knock at her door interrupted her unpacking. She opened it to find a girl about her own age with curly red hair and the most genuinely friendly smile she'd seen all day.\n\n\"Hi! I'm Piper Walsh. I live next door.\" She gestured toward the room across the hall. \"I heard we had a new senior, and I wanted to introduce myself. Starting senior year at a new school has to be terrifying.\"\n\n\"Pretty much,\" Avery admitted, stepping aside to let Piper in.\n\n\"Well, you survived orientation with Madison, which is saying something. She's not exactly the warmest welcome wagon.\" Piper flopped down on Avery's bed with the easy familiarity of someone who'd never questioned whether she belonged anywhere. \"So what's your story? Why transfer to Rosewood for senior year?\"\n\nAvery found herself telling Piper about the scholarship, her parents' ambitions, her own mixed feelings about leaving everything familiar behind. Piper listened without judgment, occasionally asking questions that showed she was actually paying attention.\n\n\"Well,\" Piper said when Avery finished, \"the good news is that Rosewood isn't as stuffy as it seems. Sure, there are the Madison Blackwood types who think their family trust funds make them royalty, but there are also normal people. You just have to know where to look.\"\n\n\"And the bad news?\"\n\nPiper hesitated, glancing toward the window where Thornfield House was visible in the distance. \"The bad news is that Rosewood has... quirks. Old schools like this, they accumulate history. And not all of it is pleasant.\"\n\n\"What kind of history?\"\n\n\"Students disappearing. Accidents that weren't accidents. Traditions that go back generations and have very specific rules about who can participate.\" Piper's voice dropped lower. \"Have you noticed the pins some students wear? The compass rose?\"\n\nAvery nodded. \"Madison had one.\"\n\n\"The Order of the Rose. They're... exclusive. Old families, old money, old secrets. Most students know better than to ask too many questions about them.\"\n\n\"And you? Do you know better?\"\n\nPiper grinned, and Avery saw something mischievous spark in her green eyes. \"I've never been very good at following rules. Which reminds me—do you want to see something cool?\"\n\nBefore Avery could answer, Piper was leading her out of the dorm and across campus. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the perfectly manicured lawns. Other students were heading toward the dining hall, their voices carrying on the evening air.\n\nPiper led her to a maintenance shed behind the science building. She produced a key from her pocket and unlocked the door.\n\n\"How did you—\"\n\n\"My dad's the groundskeeper. I've had the run of this place since I was a kid.\" Piper flicked on a flashlight and led Avery through a maze of lawn mowers and gardening equipment to a door at the back of the shed. \"This is why I wanted to show you.\"\n\nThe door opened onto a tunnel. Not a rough cave or hastily dug passage, but a proper stone tunnel with carved archways and drainage channels. It stretched into darkness beyond the reach of Piper's flashlight.\n\n\"The academy has a whole network of these,\" Piper explained, her voice echoing off the stone walls. \"They're on the original architectural plans from 1847, but they're not on any of the current maps. Most people don't even know they exist.\"\n\n\"What are they for?\"\n\n\"That's the million-dollar question. Officially? Storage and utilities. Unofficially?\" Piper shrugged. \"The Order of the Rose has been using them for meetings for over a century. My dad has seen them coming and going at all hours.\"\n\nAvery felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cool air in the tunnel. \"You're telling me there's a secret society at my new school that holds meetings in underground tunnels?\"\n\n\"Welcome to Rosewood Academy,\" Piper said cheerfully. \"Where the curriculum includes Advanced Placement Conspiracy Theories.\"\n\nAs they made their way back to the surface, Avery's mind raced. She'd expected academic pressure, social challenges, maybe some mild homesickness. She hadn't expected to stumble into what sounded like the plot of a gothic novel.\n\n\"Piper,\" she said as they locked the shed behind them, \"why are you telling me all this? We just met.\"\n\nPiper was quiet for a long moment, her expression serious for the first time since they'd met. \"Because you're going to find out anyway. Rosewood has a way of revealing its secrets, whether you want to know them or not. And when that happens, you're going to need allies.\"\n\nThey walked back toward the dorms in comfortable silence, the lights of Blackwood Hall warm and welcoming ahead of them. Behind them, Thornfield House stood dark against the evening sky, its empty windows watching like dead eyes.\n\nAvery Chen had come to Rosewood Academy expecting to spend her senior year preparing for college applications and SAT retakes.\n\nShe was beginning to suspect she was going to be preparing for something else entirely.",
